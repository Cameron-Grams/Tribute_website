      <p> My Grandmother was never comfortable talking about her youngest brother,
        the times I tried to learn more about him on a personal level her eyes would mist over
        and she couldn’t continue.  I wish I had found a way to gain greater insight
        into his life before my Grandmother passed on.</p>
      <p>Once my Grandmother shared that Walt had taken her to a Speakeasy, she did
        not provide any details--but she did smile.  At my Great Aunt Anne’s 100th birthday a distant
        Uncle from the Erisman side of the family shared an anecdote that Walt
        had been called “the Rock” when playing football.  </p>
      <p class="top_p">Walt died far too young, and did not leave a family.
        At least he was loved in life.  I hope to protect his memory.  </p>
