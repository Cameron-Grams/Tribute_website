            <p> My Grandmother was never comfortable talking about her youngest brother,
              the times I tried to learn more about him on a personal level her eyes would mist over
              and she couldn’t continue.  I wish I had found a way to gain greater insight
              into his life before my Grandmother passed on.</p>
            <p>Once my Grandmother shared that Walt had taken her to a Speakeasy, she did
              not provide any details--but she did smile.  At my Great Aunt Anne’s 100th birthday a distant
              Uncle from the Erisman side of the family shared an anecdote that Walt
              had been called “the Rock” when playing football. Sadly the remaining details of his life are few and hard to find.  </p>
            <p class="top_p">Walt died far too young, and did not leave a family.
              At least he was loved in life.  I hope to protect his memory.  </p>
